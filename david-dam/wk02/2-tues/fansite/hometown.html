                    <h3>Donald Knuth Hometown</h3>
                    <p>Donald Knuth was born on January 10, 1938 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, Ervin Henry Knuth, taught bookkeeping at Milwaukee Lutheran High School and played the organ during the Sunday services at the church. His motherâ€™s name was Louise Marie Bohning.</p>
                    <p>Donald studied at Milwaukee Lutheran High School, where he developed a love for investigating sentence structure. But although a bright student, he generally stayed away from mathematics.</p>
                    <p>Initially, he played saxophone in the school band, but later took up tuba, aiming to pursue music after graduating from school. However, he did not neglect his studies, graduating from there with highest grade point average, earning physics scholarship from the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio in 1956.</p>
