                        <p>Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work began in earnest on Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting prompted by the second edition of Volume 2. </p>

- At least 1 Google Font
- Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
- Keep your code clean and DRY
- Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/

- Why Joel admires them
- Something Joel doesn't already know about them

## Optional extras
- Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
- Record and embed a short podcast or vlog about your favourite scientist
- Try embedding other media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud)
- Try embedding a Google map (for their hometown and/or alma mater)
