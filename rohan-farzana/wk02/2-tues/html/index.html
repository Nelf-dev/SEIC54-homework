            <p>Hal Abelson is a professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.He directed the first implementation of the language Logo for the Apple II, which made the language widely available on personal computers.<br>
               <p>As much as computing is ubiquitous in our lives, it is still effectively out of reach for most people: It’s hard to understand, hard to shape to personal needs, and hard to accommodate into legal and policy framework. Professor Hal Abelson’s research in MIT CSAIL involves democratizing computing — making information technology a tool for everyone, from children in school to leaders in government.</p>
            <p>Abelson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Princeton University in 1969 after completing a senior thesis, on Actions with fixed-point set: a homology sphere, supervised by William Browder.He received his PhD in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973 after completing his research on Topologically distinct conjugate varieties with finite fundamental group supervised by Dennis Sullivan.</p>
        <p>His focus on both education and democratizing culture and intellectual resources has made him a leader in this field. He is a founding director of Creative Commons, Public Knowledge, and the Free Software Foundation. Within CSAIL he is also involved with the Internet Policy Research Initiative (IPRI), which collaborates with policy-makers and technologists to improve the trustworthiness and effectiveness of interconnected digital systems like the internet. He is also a co-author of the 2008 book Blown to Bits, which talks about the cultural and political disruptions caused by the information explosion.</p>
