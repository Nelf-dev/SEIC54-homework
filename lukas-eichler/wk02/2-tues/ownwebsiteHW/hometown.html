            <h3>Hometown</h3>

            <p>Steele was born in Missouri and graduated from the Boston Latin School in 1972. He received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in applied mathematics from Harvard University (1975) and a Master's degree (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in computer science (1977, 1980). He then worked as an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a compiler implementer at Tartan Laboratories. Then he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, where he helped define and promote a parallel computing version of the Lisp programming language named *Lisp (Star Lisp) and a parallel version of the language C named C*.</p>

            <h3>Life Growing Up</h3>

            <p>Steele and Samuel P. Harbison wrote C: A Reference Manual, (Prentice-Hall, 1984; ISBN 0-13-110016-5), to provide a precise description of the language C, which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems. Both authors participated in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C standardization process; several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard.

                On 16 March 1984, Steele published Common Lisp the Language (Digital Press; ISBN 0-932376-41-X; 465 pages). This first edition was the original specification of Common Lisp (CLtL1) and served as the basis for the ANSI standard. Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in 1990, (1029 pages) which documented a near-final version of the ANSI standard.[1</p>

            <h3>Extra Info</h3>

            <p>Guy Lewis Steele, Jr.,a.k.a. "The Great Quux", authored three books: Common Lisp: The Language; C: A Reference Manual; and The High Performance Fortran Handbook (MIT Press). He was editor of The Hacker's Dictionary, which has been revised as The New Hacker's Dictionary, edited by Eric Raymond with introduction and illustrations by Guy Steele (MIT Press). He is a co-creator of the Scheme programming language. </p>
