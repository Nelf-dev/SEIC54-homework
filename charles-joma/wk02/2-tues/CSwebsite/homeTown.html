        <p>Katherine Johnson was born as Creola Katherine 
                    Coleman on August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur 
                    Springs, West Virginia, to Joylette Roberta 
                    (n√©e Lowe) and Joshua McKinley Coleman. 
                    She was the youngest of four children. 
                    Her mother was a teacher and her father was a 
                    lumberman, farmer, and handyman. He also worked 
                    at the</p>
                    <p>Johnson showed strong mathematical abilities 
                        from an early age. Because Greenbrier County 
                        <span class="crossedOut">did not offer public schooling for African-American 
                        students past the eighth grade, the Colemans arranged 
                        for their children to attend</span> high school in Institute, 
                        West Virginia. This school was on the campus of West 
                        Virginia State College (WVSC). Johnson was enrolled 
                        when she was ten years old. The family split their 
                        time between Institute during the school year and White 
                        Sulphur Springs in the summer.</p>
                    <p>After graduation from high school at the  age of 14, Johnson matriculated at WVSC, an historically 
                            black college. <span class="crossedOut">She took every course in mathematics 
                            offered by the College. Several professors mentored her,
                            including the chemist and mathematician Angie Turner 
                            King, who had guided Coleman throughout high school, 
                            and W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African-American 
                            to receive a doctorate in mathematics.</span> Claytor added new 
                            mathematics courses just for Johnson. She graduated 
                            summa cum laude in 1937, with degrees in mathematics and 
                            French, at age 18. Johnson was a member of 
                            Alpha Kappa Alpha. She took on a teaching job at a 
                            black public school in Marion, Virginia.</p>
