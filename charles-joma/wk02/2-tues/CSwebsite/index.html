            <p><span>Being handpicked</span> to be one of <span class="crossedOut">three black students</span> to integrate West Virginia’s <span>graduate schools</span> is something that many 
                people would consider one of their life’s most notable moments, but it’s just one of <span>several breakthroughs</span> that have marked 
                <span>atherine Johnson’s long and remarkable life</span>
            <p>When West Virginia decided to quietly <span>integrate</span>its graduate schools in 1939, West Virginia State’s president, Dr. John W. 
                Davis, selected her and two men to be the first black students offered spots at the state’s flagship school, West Virginia 
                University. She left <span class="crossedOut">her</span> teaching job and enrolled in the graduate <span class="crossedOut">math program.</span> At the end of the first session, however, 
                she decided to leave school to start a family with her first husband, James Goble.</p>
            <span></span>
            <p>The <span>1957</span> launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik changed history—and Johnson’s life. In 1957, she provided some of the math 
                for the 1958 document Notes on Space Technology, a <span class="crossedOut">compendium</span> of a series of 1958 lectures <span>given</span> by engineers in the Flight 
                Research Division and the <span class="crossedOut">Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD)</span>. Engineers from those groups formed the core of the 
                Space <span>Task Group,</span> the NACA’s first official foray into space travel.  As a part of the preflight checklist, <span>Glenn asked</span>engineers to 
                “get the girl”—Johnson—to run the same numbers <span>through</span> the same <span class="crossedOut">equations</span> that had been <span class="crossedOut">programmed</span> into the computer, but by hand, on her desktop 
                <span class="crossedOut">mechanical calculating machine.</span>  “If she says they’re good,’” Katherine Johnson remembers the astronaut saying, “then I’m ready to go.”</p>
