            <h3>Where the magic happens</h1>
            <p>At Bell Labs, computing had been a branch of the Math Department since its inception in 1916. Human Computers, as they were called, were people - often women - who used and operated these machines to find mathematical solutions via carefully crafted procedures, what we call programming today. </p>
            <p>Among Shannon's first works at Bell Labs were wartime specific projects, the most notable being his work on cryptography.

            “A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography”, completed in 1945 but classified and therefore unpublished until 1949, is considered to have transformed cryptography from an art to a science. An early draft is shown here. </p>
            <p>Borrowing a term from John Tukey, Shannon explained that the information of a message should be measured in “bits” and that these bits could be thought of digitally. What Shannon's calculations proved was that the information content of a message - the number of bits - could not exceed the capacity of a given channel and there exists a fundamental limit to that capacity. The later-termed Shannon Limit is an incredibly useful benchmark for communications engineers. </p>
