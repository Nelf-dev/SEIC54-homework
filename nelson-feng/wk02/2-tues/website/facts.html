        <div class="childhood biobox"><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>Shannon kept on tinkering and inventing throughout his life, devising a flame-throwing trumpet, rocket-powered Frisbee, Rubik's cube solver, and chess-playing robots. He also built what he called the ultimate machine: a small, nondescript box with a single switch. Flipping the switch caused a tiny hand to emerge, reverse the switch, and return to rest inside the box, its one function to turn itself off again. Completely useless.</p></div>
        <div class="career biobox"><h3>Minivac601</h3>
            <p>Shannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.</p></div>

            <h3>Related to Thomas Edison?! </h3>
            <p>Shannon would learn that he and Thomas Edison were distant cousins, connected through John Ogden, an early settler in New Jersey, according to his Massachusetts Institute of Technology obituary.</p></div>
