        <p>Paragraph 2 coming soon Michael Schumacher, a German racing driver, has won 91 Grand Prix races in his career. Schumacher entered Formula One with the Jordan racing team in 1991, qualifying seventh in his debut race at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. His first Grand Prix win came the following year at the same venue. At the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher won his 52nd Grand Prix, breaking Alain Prost's record for the most career Grand Prix wins. His 2002 season, in which he was on the podium in every race, included eleven race victories. The latter broke the record for the most wins in a single season. Schumacher surpassed this with thirteen race victories in 2004. The majority of his race victories were for the Ferrari team, with 72. His most successful circuit was Magny-Cours, where he won eight times in his career. </p>
