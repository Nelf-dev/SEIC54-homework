            <h3><i class="fa fa-flash" style="font-size:24px"></i> He was an Olympic-level runner</h3>
            <p>
                He participated in a few sports, such as rowing, but he loved running. Turing had “a bit of a ‘smelly trainers’ aspect” to his personality,” Hodges said. To work it into his day, he often ran to the places he needed to go. He used to run the 10 miles between the two places where he did most of his work, the National Physical Laboratory and the electronics building on Dollis Hill, beating colleagues who took public transportation to the office.
            </p>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-tree"></i> He embodied some values of the Hippie movement</h3>
            <p>
                He shared the left-leaning views of many of his Kings College compatriots, who included economists John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Cecil Pigou. Though Turing joined the Anti-War Movement in 1933, he never got deeply involved in politics. But watching Hitler’s rise to power in the late 1930s scared him, Hodges said, and it spurred his interest in cryptography, which would later help Great Britain in the war.
            </p>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> He got bad grades and frustrated his teachers</h3>
            <p>
                Science was a considered a second-class pursuit in English public schools in the 1920s, Hodges said. Turing’s passion for science embarrassed his mother, who had hoped he would study the classics, which was the most acceptable pursuit for gentlemen.
