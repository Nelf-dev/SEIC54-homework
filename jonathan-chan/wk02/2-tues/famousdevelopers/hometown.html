            <h2><i class="fa fa-globe" style="font-size:24px"></i> Hometown</h2>
            <p>Alan turing was born in Maida Vale an affluent residential district consisting of the northern part of Paddington in West London, west of St John's Wood and south of Kilburn. It is also the name of its main road, on the continuous Edgware Road. Maida Vale is part of the City of Westminster, 3.1 miles (5.0 km) north-west of Charing Cross. It has many late Victorian and Edwardian blocks of mansion flats. The area is home to the BBC Maida Vale Studios.</p>
            <p>The name derives from a pub called The Maida (the hanging board of which used to show a likeness of Sir John Stuart, under which was the legend Sir John Stuart, the hero of Maida). The name referenced General Sir John Stuart, who was made Count of Maida, a town in Calabria, by King Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily, after victory at the Battle of Maida in 1806. The pub stood on Edgware Road near the Regent's Canal until about 2000. In recent years, a different pub (formerly The Truscott Arms) has been renamed The Hero of Maida,but is in a different location.</p>
            <p>The area is bounded by Maida Avenue and the Regent's Canal to the south, Maida Vale Road to the north-east, Kilburn Park Road to the north-west, and Shirland Road and Blomfield Road to the south-west: an area of around 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles). It makes up most of the W9 postal district.</p>
