            <h2>What did he do?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>He became famous in the 1960s for his study of the effects of mass media on thought and behaviour</li>
                <li>His most famous idea was called the "medium is the message". By which he means that the important thing about media is not the message they carry, but the way the medium itself affects human consciousness and society at large. In other words, owning a TV that we watch is more significant that anything we watch on it.</li>
                <li>He is sometimes thought of as the Father of Media. He managed to predict the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented.</li>
                <li>He wrote 8 books</li>
                <li>In his book Laws of Media he summarized his ideas about media in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examing the effects of society of any technology by dividing its effects into 4 categories.</li>
                <li>These questions are: What does the medium enhance? What does the medium make obsolete? What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier? and What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?</li>
