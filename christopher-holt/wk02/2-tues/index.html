                <li>I don't necessarily agree with everything that I say.</li>
                <li>Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today's jobs with yesterday's tools!</li>
                <li>In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is a hallucinating idiot...for he sees what no one else does: things that, to everyone else, are not there.</li>
                <li>Many a good argument is ruined by some fool who knows what he is talking about.</li>
                <li>I am an intellectual thug who has been slowly accumulating a private arsenal with every intention of using it. In a mindless age every insight takes on the character of a lethal weapon. Every man of good will is the enemy of society.</li>

Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine
Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:
Why Joel admires them
