                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>John von Neumann, (Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos) (December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath.<p>
                        <p>Considered one of the smartest individuals ever to live, vonNeumann broke new ground in several areas of mathetmatics, including quantum mechanics, game theory and geometry.</p>
                        <p>He was regarded as having perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time and was said to have been "the last representative of the great mathematicians who were equally at home in both pure and applied mathematics".</p><p>He integrated pure and applied sciences and in one of his many fields of expertise, Computer Science, he was renown for the creation of the von Neumann Architecture, which exists to a large degree in computer architecture today. The "von Neumann" architecture was inspired by his observation of how tabular data for numerical calculations were stored in memory and looked up -- he realized that programs can also be stored and looked up.</p>
